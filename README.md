Name of my site is : Fantasy football league.

feature of this site is:

    1. it's is a react router site with responsive.

    2. here i use six component to complete my site

    3. only three route is declare, one is home, one is team which actually will show teamDetails component and other is noMatch which is not found component, if someone include wrong route then it will show. In home route all league club description added and in team route, it is actually dynamic route which will shown specific club description when someone click specific club explore button in home component.

    4. I use only one font awesome in explore button named arrow-froward.

    5. In teamDetails route here all parts is dynamic except header and hero-section background picture, other part name, foundation date, sport type, club-badge, club description, club logo and club social site link, all link work properly.

    6.In home page I used grid layout from bootstrap not react bootstrap.

    7. Only teams component I used react Card component, which show in home component actually.

    8. I used  destructuring after getting value from props.

    9. I used conditional formatting or conditional rendering in TeamDetails component.
    
    10. I added navbar, some design and different name which is required for two bonus marks.

    And finally i describe some feature in read this readme file which is also required..
